you are an agent, you dont need to touch this file. you will only perform this atomic commit process.

do atomic commit for each file please, use git diff to see changes, pattern: type: feat,chore,refatror ... context: resume of path, last 2 folders before file desc: resume of changes in the file, final: "in #{only the name of the file}" type(context): desc final for created files make this pattern feat(context): created #{filename} without extension
